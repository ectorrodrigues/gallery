# gallery
A reaaalllyyy simple PHP-CSS-Jquery Gallery.

It's a simple PHP-CSS-Jquery Gallery with thumbstrip and lightbox.
The file contains the stylesheet, jquery functions and the html markups.

To use, it's just call the gallery.php file from within your page. e.g.: include('gallery.php');
It needs two DB tables to work, one to get the item data, and another to get images of that item.

The file is fully commented to help beginners to learn and alter it. Hope you enjoy. =)
